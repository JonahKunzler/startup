My idea was to create a fitness tracker application. I decided to include the elevator pitch in the home page because I thought it would be a captivating aspect of the project

Key features: 
  - Ability to track the amount of calories you intake and burn each day
  - Login to your account with username and password
  - The Workout plan you will incorporate into your daily routine
  - Ability to list our your fitness goals

Style needs to be consistent (colors, bordering, font size, etc.)
