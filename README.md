My idea was to create a fitness tracker application. I decided to include the elevator pitch in the home page because I thought it would be a captivating aspect of the project

Key features: 
  - Ability to track the amount of calories you intake and burn each day
  - Login to your account with username and password
  - The Workout plan you will incorporate into your daily routine
  - Ability to list our your fitness goals

Remember to incorporate the link to the website on my development homepage

Structure and organization need to be simple to allure viewers. Anything that comes out as too intricate will most likely be ignored.

Style needs to be consistent (colors, bordering, font size, etc.)

NOTES FOR SIMON CSS/JS:

Super Interesting how the files interact for your webpage!

Need to remember to use "git commit add" to specify the file name
Need to remember to use "git commit add" to specify the file name

Including the bootstrap is essential especially if you are incorporating CSS in the project

If it weren't for the JS functions that I implemented in the files, the application wouldn't have been interactive and I wouldn't be able to play the game/see my scores'

Javascript makes a HUGE difference!

Start UP Simon Project Insights:
I learned how useful it is to access elements from HTML in order to create my JS code. 
Without the functions I used on JS the webpage would've been useless and not interactive for the User

What I've learned from the Simon Service Project (3/22)

Node.js and express would have to be utilized in order for the service to work.
Doing this project will make it so that the record breaking scores are at the top
All deliverable files need to be in a directory called public
