# startup
My idea was to create a fitness tracker application. I decided to include the elevator pitch in the home page because I thought it would be a captivating aspect of the project

Key features: 
  - Ability to track the amount of calories you intake and burn each day
  - Login to your account with username and password
  - The Workout plan you will incorporate into your daily routine
  - Ability to list our your fitness goals

Remember to incorporate the link to the website on my development homepage

Structure and organization need to be simple to allure viewers. Anything that comes out as too intricate will most likely be ignored.

Style needs to be consistent (colors, bordering, font size, etc.)

NOTES FOR SIMON CSS/JS:

Super Interesting how the files interact for your webpage!

Need to remember to use "git commit add" to specify the file name
Need to remember to use "git commit add" to specify the file name

Including the bootstrap is essential especially if you are incorporating CSS in the project

If it weren't for the JS functions that I implemented in the files, the application wouldn't have been interactive and I wouldn't be able to play the game/see my scores'

Start UP Simon Project Insights:
I learned how useful it is to access elements from HTML in order to create my JS code. 
Without the functions I used on JS the webpage would've been useless and not interactive for the User

What I've learned from the Simon Service Project (3/22)

Node.js and express would have to be utilized in order for the service to work.
Doing this project will make it so that the record breaking scores are at the top
All deliverable files need to be in a directory called public.

MongoDB Credentials
Username: Jonahk12
Password: F*********2
Hostname: cluster0.3ormjuu.mongodb.net/

What I learned from the DB Simon Project:
Remember to have a database.js where you can add scores, get high scores, and use your mongoGB information and link to the account

What I learned from the DB Login:
Authorization services often use standard protocols for authenticating and authorizing. 
Authorization Cookie is what will make it more efficient
Make sure DB is running well prior to working on Login

What I learned from Websocket Simon:
Need to implement it with peerProxy.js which contains the protocol upgrade from HTTP to WebSocket, tracks connections, passes (or proxies) requests between connections, and implements ping/pong to keep connections alive.
play.js would have the functions for connecting, broadcasting, receiving, and displaying events.

What I learned from the start up service project: Using services, Node.js, MongoDB, authentication, and WebSockets can make it easier and faster to build web applications.

Services help make your code simpler and easier to update, while Node.js is a tool that can help make your application fast and efficient. MongoDB is a type of database that can handle a lot of information and traffic.

Authentication is important because it helps ensure that only authorized users can access your application. WebSockets allow for real-time communication between the server and the client, which can be useful for things like chat applications or online gaming.

What I Learned From The Simon React:
Make sure to install the packages before implementing React (i.e. npx create-react-app)
Make sure js files are changed to jsx
uninstall packages that I won't ever use for React
The public folder should have the front end files (html)
